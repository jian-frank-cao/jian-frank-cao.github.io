I am a Research Fellow at the Department of Political Science at Trinity College Dublin. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Florida State University. I have previously worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar at California Institute of Technology between 2019 and 2021.

I specialize in Econometrics, Political Methodology, and Computational Social Science, with a focus on comparative studies, multiple imputation, and ensuring election integrity. I develop advanced methodologies to analyze large, complex datasets in economics and political science.

My work has been published in reputable journals. You can find a copy of my CV [here](/assets/files/cv.pdf).
