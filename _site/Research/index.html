  <p><strong>Multiple Imputation for Large Multi-Scale Data With Linear Constraints.</strong> <em>(with Paul Beaumont)</em></p>

  <p><em>Abstract</em>: Current multiple imputation methods perform poorly on large and complicated Multscale data sets such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wage which can have as many as 1.5 billion observations aggregated along three different scales (industry structure, geographic levels and time) and is often heavily suppressed. In this paper we present a new method that is both efficient and accurate for handling the missing and/or suppressed value problem for large multiscale data sets. Our method incor- porates three innovations. First, we improve the accuracy of the fastest multiple imputation method, bootstrapping based expectation maximization algorithm, by incorporating a mul- tiscale updating step which uses the information from the singular covariance matrix to take the multiscale structure into account and to simulate more accurate imputations. Second, we add a quasi-Monte Carlo technique to accelerate convergence speed. Third, we develop a sequential parallel method which can detect the structure and pattern of suppressed and missing observations in large data sets, and partition the data into independent small data sets automatically. We demonstrate that the resulting Parallel Sequential Multiscale Boot- strapping Expectation Maximization Multiple Imputation method is accurate, fast, and can be applied to large data sets with complicated multiscale structures.</p>

  <p><strong>Dynamic Synthetic Controls: Accounting for Varying Speeds in Comparative Case Studies.</strong> <em>(with Thomas Chadefaux)</em></p>

  <p><em>Abstract</em>: Synthetic controls are widely used to estimate the causal effect of a treatment. However, they do not account for the different speeds at which units respond to changes. Reactions may be inelastic or “sticky” and thus slower due to varying regulatory, institutional, or political environments. We show that these different reaction speeds can lead to biased estimates of causal effects. We therefore introduce a dynamic synthetic control approach that accommodates varying speeds in time series, resulting in improved synthetic control estimates. We apply our method to re-estimate the effects of terrorism on income (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003), tobacco laws on consumption (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2010), and German reunification on GDP (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2015). We also assess the method’s performance using Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that it reduces errors in the estimates of true treatment effects by up to 70% compared to traditional synthetic controls, improving our ability to make robust inferences. An open-source R package, dsc, is made available for easy implementation.</p>

  <p><strong>Ballot Rejections and Ballot Curing in Washington State.</strong> <em>(with Canyon Foot, Jay Lee, R. Michael Alvarez, Paul Manson, and Paul Gronke)</em></p>

  <p><em>Abstract</em>: November 2020 was the first time in US history that a plurality of voters cast absentee or mail ballots. The dramatic rise of mail voting in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased attention on the potential benefits and limitations of conducting elections by mail. One of the main drawbacks to vote-by-mail policies is that states usually reject a much larger percentage of mail ballots than they do ballots cast in-person. This paper uses 27 ballot ``matchback’’ files from the state of Washington to examine, for the first time, the patterns in a state’s challenged and cured ballots. We find that younger voters, voters of color, inexperienced voters, and male voters all have substantially elevated rates of ballot rejections. These patterns are driven by disparities in signature-based ballot challenges, rather than differences in rates of ballot curing or any other part of the process. Additionally, we examine the amount of time between ballot challenges and ballot cures, geographic variation in rejection rates, and discuss potential policy interventions to reduce disparities and lower rejection rates overall.</p>
